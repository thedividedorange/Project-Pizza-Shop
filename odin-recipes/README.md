## Project Overview

### 1. HTML Basics

The project kicks off with the declaration of the HTML document type using `<!DOCTYPE html>`, ensuring compatibility with modern browsers. The character encoding is set to UTF-8 using the `<meta charset="utf-8">` tag, ensuring proper interpretation of characters on the page.

### 2. Structure Elements

The project extensively covers the use of essential HTML tags, including:

- `<html>`: The root element of an HTML page.
- `<head>`: Contains meta-information about the HTML document, such as the title and character encoding.
- `<title>`: Specifies the title of the HTML document, visible in the browser tab.
- `<body>`: Encloses the content of the HTML document, including text, images, links, and more.
- `<h1>`: Defines a top-level heading.
- `<h2>`, `<h3>`: Defines sub headings.
- `<a>`: Anchor tags

### 3. Attributes

Demonstrations of using attributes such as `href`, `lang`, `src`, `target`, `rel`, `alt`, `style` and `class` are provided throughout the project. These attributes enhance the functionality and styling of HTML elements, contributing to a well-structured and visually appealing web page.

### 4. Lists

The project covers the usage of both ordered (`<ol>`) and unordered (`<ul>`) lists. Lists are fundamental for organizing information, and you'll learn how to create structured and readable content using these list elements.
